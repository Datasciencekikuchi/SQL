# SQL Portfolio – Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of SQL-based data analysis projects demonstrating my approach to working with relational and transactional datasets in business-focused contexts.

The projects emphasise writing clear, maintainable SQL to analyse customer behaviour, operational metrics, and structured datasets, with a focus on data accuracy, logical structure, and real-world use cases.

## Projects Included

### Customer and Orders Analysis
Transactional SQL analysis across sales and customer tables to quantify order volumes, product mix, location-based purchasing, and revenue by product. Includes data-quality filtering, joins, aggregations, and customer segmentation (e.g., bulk orders and average spend).
Techniques: JOINs, DISTINCT, CASE/filters, GROUP BY, revenue calculations.

### Climate Conference Analysis
Relational SQL analysis across VIP attendees, events, and hotel reservations to quantify event participation, booking patterns, and feedback relationships, including attendees with missing event assignments.
Techniques: LEFT/INNER joins, self-joins, CASE logic, subqueries, GROUP BY aggregation.

### Fortune Companies Workforce & Benefits Analysis
SQL analysis of company workforce and benefits data to benchmark industries by revenue and headcount, evaluate employee retention using weighted average tenure, and classify benefit generosity across organisations.
Techniques: GROUP BY aggregation, subqueries, CASE classification, weighted averages.

### Solar System Dataset Profiling
SQL-based dataset exploration and classification to summarise distributions (type/shape) and flag anomalies.
Techniques: filters, CASE, GROUP BY counts.

### Superstore Pricing & Category Analysis
SQL analysis of retail product data to compare pricing across categories, calculate average price metrics, and filter high-rated items to support basic merchandising and product selection decisions.
Techniques: ORDER BY, AVG aggregation, WHERE filtering, category segmentation.
