# Stefania Kikuchi's SQL Portfolio 
# SQL Portfolio – Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of SQL-based data analysis projects demonstrating my approach to working with relational datasets, transactional data, and business-focused analysis.

The projects focus on writing clear, maintainable SQL to analyse customer behaviour, orders, and performance metrics, with an emphasis on data accuracy, logical structure, and real-world use cases.

## Projects Included

### Customer and Orders Analysis
Transactional SQL analysis across sales and customer tables to quantify order volumes, product mix, location-based purchasing, and revenue by product. Includes data-quality filtering, joins, aggregations, and customer segmentation (e.g., bulk orders and average spend).
Techniques: JOINs, DISTINCT, CASE/filters, GROUP BY, revenue calculations.

### Climate Conference Analysis
SQL analysis of a multi-table conference dataset to understand attendee participation, event engagement, hotel reservations, and feedback relationships.

The project models real-world relational data with incomplete records and demonstrates the use of appropriate join strategies, aggregations, subqueries, and case logic to produce business-readable outputs.

Key analysis includes:
- Linking VIP attendees to events, including attendees without assigned events
- Analysing hotel and dinner reservations with readable status indicators
- Identifying feedback relationships using self-joins
- Determining events and hotels with the highest participation
- Aggregating attendance metrics to compare event engagement

Techniques used: LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, SELF JOIN, CASE statements, subqueries, GROUP BY, and aggregation.
