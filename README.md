# SQL Portfolio – Business-Focused Data Analysis

## Executive Overview

This repository showcases SQL-based analytical projects designed to simulate real-world business reporting and operational analysis scenarios.

Each project begins with a defined business question, applies structured SQL analysis across relational datasets, and concludes with insights that support stakeholder decision-making.

The focus is not only technical execution, but translating raw data into actionable business intelligence.
