# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#Derived a popularity category per track by applying threshold-based conditional logic to the popularity metric.
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
danceability,
CASE
WHEN popularity > 90 THEN 'Extremely Popular'
WHEN popularity BETWEEN 50 AND 90 THEN 'Popular'
ELSE 'Not Popular'
END AS popularity_level
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE danceability > 0.5
ORDER BY danceability ASC;

#More popular tracks tend to be louder and more energetic on average.
SELECT
CASE
WHEN popularity > 70 THEN 'Popular'
ELSE 'Less Popular'
END AS popularity_group,
AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability,
AVG(energy) AS avg_energy,
AVG(loudness) AS avg_loudness
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity_group;
